# Search Valve Wiki
#### [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About

This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to easily search the **Valve Developer Community**.

It let's you right-click on selected text or any word, like a QC command or VMT Parameter, and search for it in the Valve Developer Community Wiki. If there's a page for the exact term you searched for, that page will be loaded automatically.

The plugin code is based on the [Stackoverflow Plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) script by Eric Martel and [Search WordPress Codex](https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimeWordPressCodex) by [WeLoveWordPress](http://www.wplab.de).

## Usage

### From Contextual Menu

Right click on any QC command, VMT paramenter, or similar, then select **Search in Valve Wiki** from the contextual menu.

### From Text Command

Press Ctrl + Shift + P and type `Valve Wiki`, then select **Valve Wiki: Search Selection** to search for the current selected text, or select **Valve Wiki: Custom Search** to type the text you want to search for.

### From Tools Menu

Open the **Tools** menu, and look for the **Valve Wiki** sub-menu.

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control). Package Control comes pre-installed by default with SublimText 2.

* If you didn't have Package Control and just went and installed it, make sure you have restarted Sublime Text 2.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Control+Shift+P on Linux/Windows, Command+Shift+P on OSX).
* Select **Package Control: Install Package** (it'll take a few seconds).
* When the list appears type `Valve` and the plugin should appear, select it and press enter.

Package Control will automatically keep the plugin up to date with the latest version.

If you have any problems or want to help improve the plugin, [file an issue via GitHub](https://github.com/yogensia/SublimeValveWiki/) or fork it, add your improvements and send a pull request.
