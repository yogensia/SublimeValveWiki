# Search Valve Wiki
#### [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to easily search the Valve Developer Community.

It let's you select and right-click on any documented QC comman or VMT Parameter and select 'Valve Wiki Reference' to open the wiki page for *that* element.

The plugin code is based on the [Stackoverflow Plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) script by Eric Martel and [Search WordPress Codex](https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimeWordPressCodex) by [WeLoveWordPress](http://www.wplab.de).

## Usage
Press Ctrl + Shift + P and type `Valve Wiki`, or right click on any QC command, VMT paramenter, or similar, then select 'Valve Wiki Reference' from the contextual menu.

You can also select 'Valve Wiki Search' to search the whole wiki for the selected text.

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control). Package Control comes pre-installed by default with SublimText 2.

 * If you didn't have Package Control and just went and installed it, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on OS X, Control+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds).
 * When the list appears type `Valve` and the plugin should appear, then press enter.

Package Control will automatically keep the plugin up to date with the latest version.

If you have any problems or improvements with it, [file an issue via GitHub](https://github.com/yogensia/SublimeValveWiki/).
